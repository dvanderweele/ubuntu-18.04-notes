# Notes on Ubuntu 18.04 Server Administration

**These notes are my personal notes derived from a number of videos on linux system administration found on the [LearnLinux.TV Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JtheLinuxguy).**

Additional sources include the GitHib docs as well as [this Ubuntu documentation article](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/automatic-updates.html) about Automatic Updates.
