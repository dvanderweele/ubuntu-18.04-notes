openssh-server should be installed by default on ubuntu 18.04.

If it isn't, update your package list:

	sudo apt update

Then install via apt:

	sudo apt install openssh-server

The other package that should be installed by default is
the ssh client package, which is for connecting to other
openssh-servers.

If it isn't installed, install it with:

	sudo apt install ssh

To view the ip address of the machine you're on, type:

	ip a

That command is short for:

	ip addr show
